# emacs-config
My personal emacs configuration files

## todo
- improve auto-package-installer:
	- if ping fails, try a http connection
- improve auto-theme-changer:
	- solve issue, where when converting time to pair format, extra 0's are lost
	- check if themes are loaded, if not use default theme rotation
	- custom-enabled-themes shows what themes are enabled, maybe avoid loading theme already enabled
- use-package:
	- better understand why we need to place paths in load-path variable
