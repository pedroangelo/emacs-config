# emacs-config
My personal emacs configuration files

## todo
- improve auto-package-installer:
	- if ping fails, try a http connection
- improve auto-dark-mode:
	- set target-themes: solarized-light, solarized-dark
	- check if target-themes are loaded
	- custom-enabled-themes shows what themes are enabled, maybe avoid loading theme already enabled
	- improve calling of auto-dark-mode by using a handler, that calls once at start and again at the specified times to change theme
	- avoid too much timers
