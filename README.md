# emacs-config
My personal emacs configuration files

## todo
- improve auto-package-installer:
	- if ping fails, try a http connection
- improve auto-theme-changer:
	- finish implementation, then replace auto-dark-mode
	- set target-themes: solarized-light, solarized-dark
	- check if target-themes are loaded
	- custom-enabled-themes shows what themes are enabled, maybe avoid loading theme already enabled
	- avoid too much timers
